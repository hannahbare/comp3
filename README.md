## comp3

hb-comp-challenge-3

This is our final static comp for module 1 to continue practicing HTML/CSS. I was asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. There is a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. The idea is that once I get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designerâ€™s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.
